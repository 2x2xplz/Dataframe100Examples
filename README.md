## Kotlin Dataframe in 100 Examples (Feb 12, 2024)

This Jupyter/Kotlin notebook provides 100 examples of queries and functions using the [Kotlin dataframe](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe) library.

It is a clone of  ["SQL for Data Scientists in 100 Queries"](https://gvwilson.github.io/sql-tutorial/) by [Greg Wilson](https://github.com/gvwilson), with each example translated from SQL to use Kotlin dataframe API.

*note: the original author has evolved his project... the version that was cloned to build this project [can be found here](https://2x2xplz.github.io/sql-tutorial-100queries/)*

You can quickly browse or read this project's examples online via HTML, or download the .ipynb notebook and execute it yourself interactively. It should work in a traditional Jupyter setup (browser-based, launched via Python) or, directly in IntelliJ as a Kotlin notebook.
- traditional Jupyter: requires [Kotlin kernel for Jupyter](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter)
- IntelliJ: requires [Kotlin notebook plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16340-kotlin-notebook](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2023/07/introducing-kotlin-notebook/)https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2023/07/introducing-kotlin-notebook/)

Hope this is helpful!
